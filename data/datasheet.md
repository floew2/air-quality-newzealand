## Motivation

The datasets are a collection of measurements of various pollutants at several measurement stations across New Zealand. The dataset was downloaded from the data repository of the Ministry for the Environment (MfE)[https://data.mfe.govt.nz/]

The datasets were analyzed but are not provided here in this repository. Please login to the MfE repository, download the dataset(s) and unzipp them manually. The workflow of this projects reads and processed the dbf-files, which are contained in the downloaded zip-files from the MfE repository.

The dataset includes the following columns: site, date, council, method, pm2_5, complete_for_trend, complete_for_mean, complete_year. Some of the columns are missing some values, including the measurements of the pollutant.
