    "# Air Quality Measurements in New Zealand - Exploratory Data Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore some of the available air quality data in New Zealand. The dataset came from [Ministry for the Environment](https://data.mfe.govt.nz/) and can be downloaded [here](https://data.mfe.govt.nz/tables/category/environmental-reporting/air/?q=concentrations&updated_at.after=2021-02-05T02%3A21%3A54.805Z)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this notebook is partly based on code form DeepLearning.AI and consists of the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import required Python packages and the utils.py (with additional functionality)\n",
    "2. Load the air quality data (csv) that was previously downloaded and unzipped from MfE servers, do some restructuring of the data set and convert these from DBF into CSV file format\n",
    "3. Count null values\n",
    "4. Plot histograms of different pollutants\n",
    "5. Make boxplots of pollutants at each measurement station\n",
    "6. Investigate scatterplots of different pollutants and look for correlation\n",
    "7. Generate simultaneous scatterplots and histograms across all pollutants\n",
    "8. Construct a correlation matrix to quantitatively look for correlation\n",
    "9. Look at measurements over time for different pollutants at different stations\n",
    "10. Visualize the data in a map representation"

    "\n",
    "Run the next cell to generate a map based on selected pollutanhts across New Zealand, based on the available air measuremnt data. A circle on the map shows each sensor station location. Each circle is colored based on the annual average of a selected pollutant measured at that location. Click on each sensor location to see a plot of the long-term average value and the recommended level of a pollutant. If you change where it says `hour_of_day` to `day_of_week` in the code, you'll see the daily average by day of the week in the plot when you click on each station. You can also change the pollutant to display in the map and the charts by changing the `y_variable` below."
